## ⭐️ Use the full range of knowledge acquired during the courses.

To realise this project there was some technical skill required, such as:

- 👨🏽‍💻 `JavaScript`

  - Dynamically display a gallery of pictures from backend `API`
  - Sort the gallery by category
  - Login page with autentification and token stored in `local storage`

- 🎯 `HTML`

  - Build the page using the right tags
  - Dividing the page into blocks from the wireframe to ensure a responsive design
  - Search engine optimization: use proper `HTML` semantics, fill `alt` properties
  - Code quality practices: write comments and indent code to make it maintainable and readable
  - Factorize with the right css class in order to not repeat the same code multiple time

- 📚 `CSS`

  - Hierachise the code, starting with the desktop view as we are in a desktop-first project, going top to bottom and from the bigger to the smaller view
  - Use atomic classes to avoid repetition
  - Use media query's to ensure reponsive design
  - Use `flexbox` and/or `grid`

- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👧 `GIT`

  - Use `git` for versioning
  - Create branches and open pull requests for each new feature
  - Get reviewed and apply proper corrections

- ✂️ `FIGMA`

  - Read and manipulate wireframe
  - Wireframe breakdown to ease the html construction
